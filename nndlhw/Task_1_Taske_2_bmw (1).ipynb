This approach was efficient in terms of computational cost and suited the characteristics of the dataset.\n",

        "This report provides an evaluation of a SVM classification model's performance based on precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. For class 0.0, the precision is 0.40, indicating that 40% of instances predicted as class 0.0 were correct. The recall is 0.98, meaning that 98% of actual class 0.0 instances were correctly identified. The F1-score is 0.57, representing a harmonic mean of precision and recall. For class 1.0, the precision is 1.00, indicating all instances predicted as class 1.0 were correct. The recall is 0.88, indicating that 88% of actual class 1.0 instances were correctly identified. The F1-score is 0.94. The accuracy of the model is 0.89, meaning 89% of instances were correctly classified. The macro avg precision, recall, and F1-score are 0.70, 0.93, and 0.75, respectively, while the weighted avg precision, recall, and F1-score are 0.95, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance for each class and overall accuracy."
